# QUaServer - Qt6

This is a [Qt6](https://www.qt.io/) port of the QUaServer library that provides a C++ **wrapper** for the [open62541](https://open62541.org/) library, and **abstraction** for the OPC UA Server API.

The original work (Qt5-based) can be found at https://github.com/QUaServer/QUaServer.

Only sources and assembled version of the open62541 (version 1.2.2) are included in this package.
Please refer to the original repository for build and usage instructions.
